# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Threat Detection

A machine learning-based project to detect cybersecurity threats using real-time web traffic data. Built as part of my internship to explore threat prediction, data visualization, and web-based deployment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes network traffic data to classify and detect potential cybersecurity threats using supervised ML algorithms.

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing from AWS CloudWatch logs
- Model training (Random Forest, etc.)
- Visualization of threat types and prediction accuracy
- Web integration for user interface (`index.html`)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – data analysis, modeling
- **Pandas, Scikit-learn** – data manipulation & ML
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – development environment
- **HTML/CSS/JS** – frontend visualization
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting
